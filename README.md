# VIP Logo Project

First of all, if you've stumbled on this repository and don't know what this is for, please stop by [our discord server](https://discord.me/vipgc)!

This is the Github Repository for VIPGC Members to access the necessary Blender, Texture, and resource files for the Logo Project. If you wish to contribute, please create a separate branch to carry out your work on so that it may be reviewed and merged into the master branch.

The structure of the VIP Logo repository has been updated to give an certain categorization to the VIP Logos you might be looking for. The intent will be to add in blender files for images that match festive themes, flags for your homeland, and other acceptable aspects of the project. Consider this a folder for approved renditions of the logo that was produced toward the end of last year.

The primary image has converged on the color red, but if there is desire to update this to a new color, texture, or design, please include VIP leadership.
