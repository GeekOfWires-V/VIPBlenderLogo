# Guide to the Repository

## Open the Site

First, visit the [Github Repository](https://github.com/GeekOfWires-V/VIPBlenderLogo/).

<p align="center">

</p>

This page is available to the public. My VIP Github account is <span class="basic-text-shadow">GeekOfWires-V</span> and is currently owner of/hosting the Github repostiry. For the sake of this guide, I'll be accessing using my personal account, <span class="basic-text-shadow">GeekOfWires</span>, which is a separate account and has not been granted any special privileges.

## Adding Changes

When trying to upload a file, look for the Add File button, that can be found at the top of the repository page just under the repository header section.

</p>

### Create Subdirectory

When pressing this button, a drop down will reveal "Create new file" and "Upload files". If you have not created a directory yet, select <span class="green-text-shadow">Create new file</span> and name it YOURNAME/README.md. This will create a new directory with yourname and place a blank readme inside it. Name the branch "YOURNAME-derivatives". Propose the new file, and then afterwards, just click <span class="green-text-shadow">Create pull request</span>.

If you have already done this, select YOURNAME-derivatives branch:

### Getting Contributor Access

When uploading, you need contributor access. If you don't have it, you'll see this page:

<p align="center">
<img src="GuideImages/firefox_2020_August_22_175901547_GrIRgmfxk9.png" />
</p>

Ask GeekOfWires#4782 for contributor access, or fork it, commit to your fork, and then make a pull request to merge it into the master/personal derivatives branch. You can ping me in #public-chat or #vip-social.

After being invited, go to your Github notifications in the top right to visit the notification page.

<p align="center">
<img src="GuideImages/firefox_2020_August_22_181259533_svtkco0uip.png" />
</p>

Click on the notification to bring up the page to accept the invitation.

</p>

Now you can proceed with publishing your changes to the repository.

Make sure when you upload, you have:

- Moved to the correct directory
- Moved to the correct branch
- When your branch has changes that you feel satisfied with, make a pull request so that your branch can be shifted into the master or main derivatives branch.

**The longest part of this process is the initial setup. If you believe that this is too extraneous, please send/message the files that will be added to the repository to GeekOfWires so that the changes can be previewed by the rest of the community.**
